# Non-Linear-classification-model

We discuss about how to perform a binary classification using non linear model with neural network concepts

> A detailed explanation regarding the topics covered in this model can be found at [medium](https://naveen-varma.medium.com/non-linear-classification-model-using-deep-neural-networks-p-2-9d602c99bcf5)

## Code Excecution:
1. Download the notebook file from this repo.
2. Install jupyter Notebook through anaconda installer.
3. Install all required Libraries like Tensorflow, keras, Matplotlib.
4. That's it you are good to go. Open jupyter notebook and run all cells and check out the implementation.

### Remainder:
- All neural networks are referred as Artificial Neural Networks(ANN). The neural networks with more than one hidden layer are called Deep Neural Networks(DNN). Convolutional Neural Networks(CNN) are mainly used in image processing.
